Simple API wrapper for Zonomi DNS service.

See source for documentation, class resides within __init__.py
All functions contain inline documentation to get you started, most are fairly simple.

findip.py includes a simple function to find your public IP address, useful when using
on any server where the IP address is likely to change. Could be used with cron to setup
a dynamic IP client.

Not a complete solution, will add to it as the need arises, feel free to fork.

See https://zonomi.com/app/dns/dyndns.jsp
for more available functions.
